            <h1>Fighter Class Details</h1>
            <p>A human in clanging plate armor holds her shield before her as she runs toward the massed goblins. An elf
                behind her, clad in studded leather armor, peppers the goblins with arrows loosed from his exquisite
                bow. The half-orc nearby shouts orders, helping the two combatants coordinate their assault to the best
                advantage.</p>
            <p>A dwarf in chain mail interposes his shield between the ogre's club and his companion, knocking the
                deadly blow aside. His companion, a half-elf in scale armor, swings two scimitars in a blinding whirl as
                she circles the ogre, looking for a blind spot in its defenses.</p>
            <p>A gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with his trident and net, skilled at toppling foes and
                moving them around for the crowd's delight—and his own tactical advantage. His opponent's sword flares
                with blue light an instant before she sends lightning flashing forth to smite him.</p>
            <p>All of these heroes are fighters, perhaps the most diverse class of characters in the worlds of Dungeons
                & Dragons. Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened
                mercenaries, and bandit kings—as fighters, they all share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and
                armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they are well acquainted with death, both
                meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.</p>

                        <p>Fighters learn the basics of all combat styles. Every fighter can swing an axe, fence with a
                            rapier,
                            wield a
                            longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill.
                            Likewise, a fighter is
                            adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each
                            fighter
                            specializes in a
                            certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at
                            once,
                            and
                            some on
                            augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability and
                            extensive
                            specialization
                            makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike.</p>

                                        fighter.
                                        Most of
                                        these troops are

                                        trained bodyguards, dedicated knights, and similar figures are fighters.</p>

                                        monster
                                        slaying,
                                        and other
                                        dangerous work common among adventurers is second nature for a fighter, not all
                                        that
                                        different from
                                        the life he or
                                        she left behind. There are greater risks, perhaps, but also much greater
                                        rewards—few
                                        fighters in the
                                        city watch have
                                        the opportunity to discover a magic flame tongue sword, for example.</p>

                        <p>As you build your fighter, think about two related elements of your character's background:
                            Where
                            did
                            you get your
                            combat training, and what set you apart from the mundane warriors around you? Were you
                            particularly
                            ruthless? Did
                            you get extra help from a mentor, perhaps because of your exceptional dedication? What drove
                            you
                            to
                            this training in
                            the first place? A threat to your homeland, a thirst for revenge, or a need to prove
                            yourself
                            might

                        <p>You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble's army or in a local militia. Perhaps you
                            trained
                            in a war academy,
                            learning strategy, tactics, and military history. Or you might be self-taught—unpolished but
                            well
                            tested. Did you
                            take up the sword as a way to escape the limits of life on a farm, or are you following a
                            proud
                            family tradition?
                            Where did you acquire your weapons and armor? They might have been military issue or family
                            heirlooms, or perhaps
                            you scrimped and saved for years to buy them. Your armaments are now among your most
                            important
                            possessions—the only
                            things that stand between you and death's embrace.</p>

                        Your next-highest
